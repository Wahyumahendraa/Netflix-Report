## 📚 Insights Summary

### 📈 Content Growth Over the Years  
Netflix’s content library expanded slowly from 2008 to 2014. A significant turning point occurred in 2015, followed by explosive growth until 2019, peaking at over 2,000 titles. Post-2019, the number of additions decreased—possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic or a strategic focus on content quality and cost control.

### 🎞️ Content Type Distribution  
Movies dominate Netflix's catalog with over 6,000 titles, while TV shows account for around 2,700. This skew toward films reflects a broader appeal, though the sizable show count highlights the importance of binge-worthy, episodic content for user retention.

### 🕰️ Release Year Trends  
Older content is rare on the platform. A steady increase in content from the 2000s is visible, culminating in a sharp rise post-2010. Most titles were released between 2018 and 2020, suggesting Netflix’s focus on providing contemporary, fresh content to meet modern viewer preferences.

### 🎭 Rating Distribution  
The platform leans heavily into mature content, with TV-MA as the most common rating (~3,200 titles), followed by TV-14 and TV-PG. This indicates a strong targeting of teen and adult demographics, with relatively limited family-friendly offerings.

### 🌍 Content by Country  
The United States contributes the majority of content, with over 3,200 titles. However, countries like India, the UK, Japan, South Korea, and France show Netflix's global content strategy in action. This regional diversification supports the platform's expansion into new international markets.
